      Namaste! Welcome to FoodCounter, a unique experience capturing the cultural splendour and culinary richness of a preserve civilization largely untouched by modern influences. Although our proud history goes back hundreds of years the Nepalese cuisine was only introduced into the UK in the late 1970's. Due to this, more and more people travel to Nepal to see and experience our wonderful culture. Nepal is a country rich in history famous for its snow covered peak of Sagamartha (Mt Everest) and also for the Gurka Regiment, who have served with great distinction alongside the British Army for over 200 years. The diversity along with its colourful history has developed the Nepalese cuisine into a rich fusion of Indian and Tibetian flavours. Good food is all about fine recips, ingredients cooking methods, timings and the touch of a great culinary chef. Inspired by everything from tangy street snacks and home-style curries to exotic vegetarian and seafood delicacies of Southern Asia, each dish has its unique tastes and flavour.
